        <p class="tomPera"> <strong>Tom and Jerry is an American cartoon series about a hapless cat's never-ending pursuit of a clever mouse. Tom is the scheming cat, and Jerry is the spunky mouse. The series was driven entirely by action and visual humour; the characters almost never spoke.A number of spin-offs have been made, including the television series The Tom and Jerry Show (1975), The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show (1980–1982), Tom & Jerry Kids (1990–1993), Tom and Jerry Tales (2006–2008), and The Tom and Jerry Show (2014–2021).</strong> </p>
    
        <p class="tomPera">In 1821, British writer Pierce Egan wrote Life in London, the stories of a couple of roustabout toughs named, you guessed it, Tom and Jerry. The book was so successful that it inspired a stage play and a boozy eggnog cocktail called the Tom and Jerry that would ultimately outlast the popularity of the source material.A number of spin-offs have been made, including the television series The Tom and Jerry Show (1975), The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show (1980–1982), Tom & Jerry Kids (1990–1993), Tom and Jerry Tales (2006–2008), and The Tom and Jerry Show (2014–2021). The first feature-length film based on the series, Tom and Jerry: The Movie, was released in 1992, and 13 direct-to-video films have been produced since 2002, with a live-action/animated hybrid film released in 2021. A musical adaptation of the series, titled Tom and Jerry: Purr-Chance to Dream, debuted in Japan in 2019 in advance of Tom and Jerry's 80th anniversary.</p>
    
        <p class="tomPera">Tom never gives up in his desire to catch Jerry, and Jerry never loses a fight. He is inventive, courageous and stronger than he looks. In almost all the early with cartoons there is a repeated gag when Jerry grabs a plank and bashes Tom's behind with great force and verve. He enjoys inflicting the painA number of spin-offs have been made, including the television series The Tom and Jerry Show (1975), The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show (1980–1982), Tom & Jerry Kids (1990–1993), Tom and Jerry Tales (2006–2008), and The Tom and Jerry Show (2014–2021).
